<h1>Post-mortem analysis of our forecasts per country</h1>
<p>In addition to our efforts in developing accurate nowcasts during the challenge, we also conducted a thorough post mortem analysis of our forecasting methodology. This analysis allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of each of the models we utilized and to identify areas for improvement in our approach. By analyzing the performance of each model against the actual values of the target variables, we were able to determine which models were best suited for each challenge and adjust our modeling accordingly. This post mortem analysis provided us with valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our approach, allowing us to continually refine and improve our modeling techniques.</p>
<p>You have the ability to select a specific country of interest and analyze the performance of the different models from the beginning of the challenge.</p>
